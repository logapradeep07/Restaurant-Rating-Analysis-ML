# Restaurant-Rating-Analysis-ML
End-to-end Data Science project analyzing restaurant ratings using EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning.
# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Data Science solution developed during my **Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**.
The objective is to analyze restaurant data, extract insights through exploratory analysis, and build machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Cognifyz Internship Dataset
- Format: CSV
- Records include restaurant ratings, price range, votes, cuisine types, location, and services.
## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
- Data loading
- Column standardization
- Initial inspection

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Rating distributions
- Price range vs ratings
- City & cuisine analysis
- Correlation heatmap

📊 Visualizations saved in `/figures`

### 3️⃣ Internship Tasks
- Table booking vs ratings
- Online delivery vs price range
- Votes vs rating relationship
- Top cuisines and cities analysis
  
### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Binary feature encoding
- Feature creation (lengths, counts)
- Missing value handling

### 5️⃣ Machine Learning Modeling
Models implemented:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

📈 Performance evaluated using:
- MAE
- RMSE
- R² Score

Results saved in `/results/model_comparison.csv`
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook
## 📊 Results Summary
Random Forest achieved the best performance among the tested models, capturing non-linear relationships in restaurant ratings effectively.
